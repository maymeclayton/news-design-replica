Notes:

This was a warm up project for bootcamp in which we were instructed to replicate the style and behavior of the NPR website
utilizing Bootstrap. The site should be responsive to all screen sizes. The advertisement in the right hand column
should disappear when viewing the site on smaller screens and the rest should stack on top of one another.
